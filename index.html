                I will dearly miss steve jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved
                them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man a awesome CEO for APPLE He ha s 
                inspired  me to one day go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and 
                follow by Steve Jobs wayand make Apple greater than before it was.But i will dearly miss steve jobs he's a great man
                and i will never forget him.

                i ever encountered a PC.steve jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future i dreaned of as a kid 
                And through his vision.I have been able to realize my own.ypu'll be missed.Mr jobs Thanks for all your 
                amazing work
